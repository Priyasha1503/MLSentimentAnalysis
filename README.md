🧠 What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment Analysis (also known as opinion mining) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

It’s commonly used to analyze:

Customer feedback
Product reviews
Social media posts
Survey responses
Public opinion on events or topics
This project uses the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model, which is a pre-trained, lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool designed especially for social media and short texts. VADER can detect sentiment with reasonable accuracy and even understands emojis, slang, and capitalization!

✅ Example Inputs & Outputs:
Input Text	Sentiment
"I absolutely love this app!"	Positive 😊
"This is the worst experience ever."	Negative 😞
"It’s okay, not great but not terrible."	Neutral 😐
The model works by assigning a compound score between -1 (most negative) and +1 (most positive), with thresholding to categorize sentiment.
